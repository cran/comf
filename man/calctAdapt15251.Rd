\title{Adaptive Comfort or Neutral Temperatures}
\usage{
calctAdapt15251(trm = 20)

calctAdaptASHRAE(tmmo)

calctnAuliciems(ta, tmmo)

calctnHumphreysNV(tmmo)

calctnHumphreysAC(tmmo)
}
\arguments{
\item{trm}{numerical value presenting the running mean outdoor temperature in [degree C].}

\item{ta}{numerical value presenting the indoor air temperature in [degree C].}

\item{tmmo}{numerical value presenting the mean monthly outdoor temperature in [degree C].}
}
\value{
returns the adaptive comfort or neutral temperature with respect to the given outdoor temperature value
}
\description{
\code{calctadapt} are three functions to calculate adaptive comfort or neutral temperatures based on a given outdoor temperature value.
}
\note{
The difference between \code{calctnHumphreysNV} and \code{calctnHumphreysAC} is that the former was found for natural ventilated buildings (NV), while the latter was found for climate-controlled buildings (AC).
}
\examples{
## define variable
trm <- 21.2
## calculate adaptive comfort temperature
calctAdapt15251(trm)
