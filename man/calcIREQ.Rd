\usage{
calcIREQ(M,W,ta,tr,p,w,v,rh,clo)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{a numeric value presenting metabolic energy production (58 to 400 W/m2) in [W/m2]}

\item{W}{a numeric value presenting Rate of mechanical work, (normally 0) in [W/m2]}

\item{ta}{a numeric value presenting ambiant air temperature in [degree C]}

\item{tr}{a numeric value presenting mean radiant temperature in [degree C]}

\item{p}{a numeric value presenting air permeability (low < 5, medium 50, high > 100 l/m2s) in [l/m2s]}

\item{w}{a numeric value presenting walking speed (or calculated work created air movements) in [m/s]}

\item{v}{a numeric value presenting relative air velocity(0.4 to 18 m/s) in [m/s]}

\item{rh}{a numeric value presenting relative humidity [\%]}

\item{clo}{a numeric value presenting clothing insulation level in [clo]}
}
\value{
\code{calcIREQ} returns
\item{IREQminimal }{Lower bound of insulation required in [clo]}
\item{IREQneutral }{Upper bound of insulation required in [clo]}
\item{ICLminimal }{Lower bound of REQUIRED basic clothing insulation (ISO 9920) in [clo]}
\item{ICLneutral }{Upper bound of REQUIRED basic clothing insulation (ISO 9920) in [clo]}
\item{DLEminimal }{Lower bound of duration limited exposure in [hours]}
\item{DLEneutral }{upper bound of duration limited exposure in [hours]}

\description{
Calculate minimal and neutral values of REQUIRED CLOTHING INSULATION (IREQ) and DURATION LIMITED EXPOSURE (Dlim).
}
\details{
The function gives IREQ Insulation of clothing required to maintain thermal equilibrium of the body at specified levels of physiological stress.
