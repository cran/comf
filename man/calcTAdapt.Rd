\title{
Calculating Adaptive Comfort Temperatures or Neutral Temperatures
}
\description{
\code{calctadapt} are three functions to calculate adaptive comfort or neutral temperatures based on a given outdoor temperature value.
}
\usage{
calctAdapt15251(trm = 20)
calctnAuliciems(ta, tmmo)
calctnHumphreysNV(tmmo)
calctnHumphreysAC(tmmo)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ta}{
numerical value presenting the indoor air temperature in [degree C] 
}
  \item{trm}{
numerical value presenting the running mean outdoor temperature in [degree C] 
}
  \item{tmmo}{
numerical value presenting the mean monthly outdoor temperature in [degree C] 
}
}
\value{
returns the adaptive comfort or neutral temperature with respect to the given outdoor temperature value
}
