\title{PMV and PPD}
\usage{
calcPMVPPD(ta, tr, vel, rh, clo=.5, met=1, wme=0, basMet=58.15, getLoad = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ta}{a numeric value presenting air temperature in [degree C]}

\item{tr}{a numeric value presenting mean radiant temperature in [degree C]}

\item{vel}{a numeric value presenting air velocity in [m/s]}

\item{rh}{a numeric value presenting relative humidity [\%]}

\item{clo}{a numeric value presenting clothing insulation level in [clo]}

\item{met}{a numeric value presenting metabolic rate in [met]}

\item{wme}{a numeric value presenting external work in [met]}

\item{basMet}{a numeric value presenting basal metabolic rate [w/m2]}

\item{getLoad}{a boolean value. Set to true to get thermal load as output instead of PMV/PPD}
}
\value{
PMV - Predicted Mean Vote

PPD - Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied occupants in [\%]

Lraw - thermal load (only when getLoad was set to TRUE)
}
\description{
Function to calculate Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD).
}
\details{
The PMV is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation of a large group of people on a sensation scale expressed from (-3) to (+3) corresponding to the categories cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm and hot. The PPD is an index that establishes a quantitative prediction of the percentage of thermally dissatisfied people determined from PMV.

Note that the adjustments in the value for basMet need to be made with great cautiousness as the PMV calculation is an empirical model and might not be valid for other values of basMet than the one commonly used.
